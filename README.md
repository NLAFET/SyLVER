# SyLVER

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/sylver/badge/?version=latest)](https://sylver.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

SyLVER is a sparse direct solver for symmetric systems which may be
either positive-definite or indefinite. 

The implementation uses DAG-based algorithms that enable an efficient
exploitation of multicore CPU architectures and GPU-accelerated
systems. The parallel implementation relies on the
[StarPU](http://starpu.gforge.inria.fr/) runtime system developed and
maintained by the STORM team at Inria Bordeaux Sud-Ouest.

The code has been developed in the context of the EU H2020
[NLAFET](http://www.nlafet.eu/) project.

# Installation 

The compilation of the code is handled by the
[CMake](https://cmake.org/) tools. For example, the compilation can be
achieved as follow:

```bash
mkdir build # create build directory
cd build 
cmake <path-to-source> -DSYLVER_RUNTIME=StarPU -DSYLVER_ENABLE_CUDA=ON # configure compilation
make # run compilation 
```

## Third-party libraries ##

### SPRAL ###

[SPRAL](https://github.com/ralna/spral) is an open-source library for
sparse linear algebra and associated algorithm and has several
important features used in SyLVER. The latest release of SPRAL can be
found on its [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/ralna/spral/releases).

SPRAL is automatically built during the compilation of SyLVER. See
[documentation](https://sylver.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)
if you wish to use your own version of SPRAL for building SyLVER.

### MeTiS ###

The [MeTiS](http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/metis/metis/overview)
partitioning library is needed by the SPRAL library and therefore,
needed when linking the SyLVER package for building examples and test
drivers.

When compiling SyLVER you can provide the path to the MeTiS library
using either `-DMETIS_DIR` CMake option or the `METIS_DIR`
environment variable.

### hwloc ###

The [hwloc](https://www.open-mpi.org/projects/hwloc/) library is
topology discovery library which is necessary for linking the examples
and test drivers if SPRAL was compiled with it. In this case, the
library path can be given to CMake using either the `-DHWLOC_DIR`
CMake option or the `HWLOC_DIR` environment variable.

### Runtime system ###

The `-DSYLVER_RUNTIME=StarPU` enables the compilation of the parallel
version of SyLVER using [StarPU runtime
system](http://starpu.gforge.inria.fr/). In this case the StarPU
version needs to be at least 1.3.0. The StarPU library is found with
the `FindSTARPU.cmake` script located in the `cmake/Modules`
directory. Note that, for this script to be able to find the StarPU
library, you need to set the environment variable `STARPU_DIR` to the
path of you StarPU install base directory.

By default, CMake will configure the compilation for a parallel
version of SyLVER using StarPU. The sequential version can be compiled
using the option `-DSYLVER_RUNTIME=STF`.

### BLAS and LAPACK ###

The BLAS and LAPACK libraries play an important role in the
performance of the solver. We recommend using the
[MKL](https://software.intel.com/mkl) library for best performance on
Intel machines and the
[ESSL](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSFHY8/essl_welcome.html)
library when running on IBM machines. Alternative BLAS and LAPACK
libraries include [OpenBLAS](https://www.openblas.net/). Note that
SyLVER should be linked against the **sequential** BLAS and LAPACK
libraries.

These libraries are found via the CMake scripts
[FindBLAS](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FindBLAS.html)
and
[FindLAPACK](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FindBLAS.html)
and therefore it is possible to use the options `-DBLA_VENDOR` to
indicate which libraries to use. For example:

```bash
cmake <path-to-source> -DBLA_VENDOR=Intel10_64lp_seq # configure compilation
```

selects and locates the sequential BLAS and LAPACK implementation for
the compilation and when linking test drivers, example and tests.

If CMake is unable to locate the requested libraries via the
`-DBLA_VENDOR`, it is still possible to give them explicitly using the
`-DLLBAS` and `-DLLAPACK` options. For example:

```bash
cmake <path-to-source> -DLBLAS="-L/path/to/blas -lblas" -DLLAPACK="-L/path/to/lapack -llapack" # configure compilation
```
